--Nashville Housing dataset--
-I cleaned the data up by deleting unused columns or duplicates, unifying selling information, seperating addresses into multiple columns (Street, City, State), and reformatting the dates to be easier to use. I had to go down a stack overflow rabbit hole to get the duplicate columns to all delete at once, but it was worth it to run that codeblock. 
-Changing the date, which was currently a string, to a DATE type was a bit of a headache, since I first had to change the string to DATETIME, and THEN change that to DATE since the INSERT INTO arguement didn't error out when just using STR_TO_DATE, but also didn't do what I wanted it to, but it was such a relief when I finally got it to work!
--Automobile Data Cleaning--
-Here I took the dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile from the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook to do some cleaning. It was fairly straightforward data cleaning, and I used the data description at the link to check if there were any values outside the range of the correct values.
