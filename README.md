In the Nashville Housing dataset I cleaned the data up by deleting unused columns or duplicates, unifying selling information, seperating addresses into multiple columns (Street, City, State), and reformatting the dates to be easier to use. I had to go down a stack overflow rabbit hole to get the duplicate columns to all delete at once, but it was worth it to run that codeblock.
